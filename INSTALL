Help Hannah's Horse 2.0
-----------------------

August 2020


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Help Hannah's Horse uses the GNU Autotools framework for compilation and installation.

To compile the game type:

./configure

which will check all dependencies, including a suitable c++ compiler, are installed.
If this completes successfully, type:

make

to build the game. To run locally, type:

./hannah

or to install globally type:

make install

To change the default install location, pass the --prefix parameter to the ./configure step:

./configure --prefix=~/usr

to install, for example, to a usr folder under your home directory.

If you've chosen to install globally, you can now delete the whole source directory.

There are a number of command-line parameters that can be used and these can be displayed by running:

hannah --help


Prerequisites
-------------

You will need SDL (>=2.0.5), SDL_image, SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf installed and their appropriate devel packages
and you will also need g++ (part of the Gnu Compiler Collection).


Windows
-------

A 64bit Windows installer is available from the project homepage, but Makefile.Windows is included which should
(possibly with a bit of coaxing) build on Mingw_64 for Windows.
