Release Notes 2.0.0
-----------------------

Hannah 2.0.0 is the first release linked against SDL2.0. The last version that can compile against SDL1.2 is Hannah version 1.2.


Features of 2.0.0
-----------------------
* Compiles against SDL 2.0
* New in-game menu system
* Joystick support (a little experimental)
* Three difficulty modes, include "Insane": no powerpills, faster ghosts and a "fog of war" over most of the screen
* A new power down (the robber - he makes you drop your coins)
* Further code improvements (even more to come!)
* Autotools support for POSIX-system compilation (sorry Windows users)

Features of 1.2.0
-----------------------

* New Windows Installer
* New music! Was never sure of the copyright status of the old music, as I just found it online, so 
   the new music is written entirely by me and thus copyright me!
* Updated graphics - the horrible purple and handwritten fonts have gone, replaced by
   8-bit style pastel shades and ModeSeven.
* New animations for Hannah!
* Extra lives! I can't believe I made the game this tough and didn't have any extra lives,
   so you now get a new life every 5000 points. This boundary might change.
* Ghosts move away from Hannah when she's eaten a powerpill (well, not the red one, he's random)
* Fixed niggly bugs like Hannah being momentarily visible after dying
* Game can now be run in Linux without installation
* Removed lots and lots of commented code from the source files.

Installation (POSIX)
----------------------

./configure

make

make install

Aim
---

If you've ever played Pacman, you'll know what to do here. Collect the coins and avoid the ghosts. To make things
more interesting there are also moving carrots that need to be collected (sentient vegetables - scary!) and powerups 
and downs to collect or avoid. There are also a smattering of obstacles.

These are:

* Red and White - only the ghosts can cross them
* Blue and White - only hannah can cross them
* Wooden gates - both hannah and the ghosts can cross, but only passing from below to above
* Cross poles - collect the red key to open them (cross poles with a key hole?)

Running with -f (/f on Windows) will run the game full screen.

There are currently 15 levels. It'll probably crash after that.

I would LOVE some feedback (good, bad, bugs...) to yottskry_at_gmx_dot_net (you can figure that out I'm sure)
