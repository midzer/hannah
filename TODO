# DONE! Implement powerpills
# DONE! Implement collision detection for ghosts
# DONE! (ish)Better graphics 
Extra features - moving food, powerups / downs etc (change speed? That's easiest...). One way doors (already have one)

# DONE! Next - need to reimplement the sprite class so that sprites can have different graphic/animation for each state, e.g. ghosts can flash when powerpill is active.
Win32 makefile and confirm it works.
